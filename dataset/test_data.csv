spanish members from all parties have made important contributions to the work of this house, holding distinguished office in both parliament and in our groups.
this is not the fault of the un human rights council, but that council has to assume some responsibility for not finding ways to make its voice heard more seriously.
they are so well-suited to the activity, and it is self-evident that we must protect that environment.

mr. president, i am voting in favour of this report today.
that really is what this is all about.
what, if anything, did the information offices do to rebut the allegations made in this television programme?
in principle, only restaurants and construction services might have a significant potential budgetary impact.
its unique feature is that it sets legally binding rules on investment protection transit and that it contains provisions on dispute resolution in the energy sector.

this is an area of deep concern.
i was invited in may of this year to lead a small delegation of meps and visit mauritania, which i did.

that really demonstrates the vital importance of nato and its maintenance.
we further need a more harmonised system of end-use data provision, certification and enforcement.
if we are going to introduce an electronic system, it has got to be practical and cost-effective, and farmers have got to be able to use it practically.
it is a semi-state company and it is responsible for forestry development.

we have been waiting for it for too long now.
we are also open to giving even greater visibility to fundamental rights in our impact assessments.
however, just when intensified dialogue and cooperation with our neighbours is badly needed, the eu has drawn down another curtain through some aspects of the expanded schengen area.
in conclusion, i wish to thank the members.
i cannot see how it is possible to amend it now or to ask for more derogations.
if we had that person in place now we would not have the zigzagging that goes on between the six-monthly presidencies.
moreover, i believe that assistance to developing countries should be constantly adapted to the circumstances in those countries.
the debate is closed.
none of this is law at the moment.
maybe the two rapporteurs could help us or be with us at these events.
that is a rather low level from him.
in this regard, i believe that the reformed cohesion policy has clearly helped to strengthen the position of the outermost regions under the cooperation objective.

mr president, the european security and defence policy is on the brink of a historic step.
as regards financing, i do not support the idea of financing the eit from the common agricultural policy fund, as nobody can foresee the next year's harvest in agriculture.
the directive applies to organised distance marketing schemes not to face-to-face schemes with the occasional distance transaction.
are they going to support the budget line issues?
when i was in cape town for the acp, it was absurd that local producers were asking me to help them.
however, i am very concerned that the commissioner, backed by the rapporteur, a british conservative rapporteur, is adding at this stage six new tens priority projects.
turning to enforcement, i am pleased to see that parliament shares the commission's view about the importance of giving people in practice the rights they have on paper.

there has been much debate within the european union in recent times concerning what is known as the principle of enhanced cooperation.
we also need to ensure that we are reforming the european market.
however, we are almost at the end.
there are a number of other serious implications arising from parttime work which should be brought to the attention of the commission.
madam president, there have been a lot of changes between the first and second readings.
saying 'sod the cod', allowing fishing to continue and hoping for the best is hardly an option, nor is renationalising the cfp.
most of the structural problems identified at lisbon remain obstacles to wealth creation.
subsequently, it was withdrawn and i understand that the commission has now come to a view on the funding of european political parties.
civil society and the social partners will be fully involved in implementing the european year.
in this field there is a lot to do.
then let us get on with trying to find the money to build them and to create the jobs which we so sorely need in this community.

no one had conceived of using a fully loaded, large passenger plane as a weapon.

rather, our future trade strategy should also see it as an additional means to promote european values and interests.
television programmes aired in russian will systematically be subtitled in belarusian.
without this feedback we are doomed to work in a vacuum.
escalating food prices are increasingly leading to rioting on the streets, and we need a fresh approach if we are to deal with this situation.
hence the worrying decline in meat consumption.
i believe the way forward is to reduce the supply and then try to increase demand to get the industry back on its feet.

since the overthrowing of taliban, the situation in afghanistan has improved, however in reality, there have not been many positive developments as far as human rights are concerned.

their desire to present this petition was notified to parliament weeks in advance.

we have had enough of this.

by bringing europe's cultural and scientific heritage online, we can disseminate it through into different cultures.
i know that part of the next generation of the ‘geant’ programme, which the commissioner launched last week, will address that issue.
mr president, on a point of order.
the programme provides the union with an instrument to promote active european citizenship.
we have other serious concerns.
we do not need another array of regulation or army of inspectors.
mr president, we need to finish voting on that report before any personal declarations are made.
there must be more transparency and objectivity as far as regional funds are concerned.
this is a good basis and also one of the reasons why parliament and commission are in harmony about where we go now.
we look to all the appropriate institutions for their endorsement of this approach.
i hope that the european parliament motion for a resolution to be adopted on this issue will bring us together in defending european values and the future of europe.
we have a responsibility in this house to deal with these issues.
that is why we must work together to solve the problem.
i wish to turn to the proposals on accidents and injuries which i believe could offer the furthest-reaching impact on the lives of ordinary citizens.
that is more of a policy for disintegration than integration and competitiveness.

in countries that have introduced gender equality-friendly legislation, women's representation on the labour market tends to be significantly higher, as well as the percentage of birth rate.
what has been done to deliver that promise for working people?
this development points to persistent structural rigidities in the labour markets of the euro area.
i have no further points to make and i do apologise for being late.

concerning deforestation, of course it is a great issue and linked both to biodiversity and climate change - equally important.
it is particularly concerned over breaches of fundamental freedoms, such as the freedom of expression, association and assembly.
failure in un-led efforts to tackle the threat of terrorism and proliferation would endanger the prosperity of the developing world as much as the developed.
in light of this, we should not lose sight of the promise made in the report, 'to guarantee (people living from fishing) an equitable standard of living.'
peace will only be achieved in nepal through the democratic process.
that we do not have clear targets, that we cannot measure output, is really unacceptable and would not happen in any other institution.
the recent parliamentary election in iran will we hope offer an opportunity to develop a more productive dialogue on human rights with the iranian government.
most of the time, we are proposing new legislation in this house, but today we modified a piece of legislation.
i can see the internal consistency of what you are saying as a euro-integrationalist, which i am not.
ccctb is one of those proposals.
this is clearly part of the accession treaty commitment.
i would urge the members of the committee to sharpen their interrogating skills and we will get answers, because that is a priority.
let me add a few comments on what i said earlier in this respect.
my group wants this parliament to be strong, because we cannot conceive of a strong european union without it.
it is not political.
i am all for environmental sustainability because the future does not belong to us.
consumer protection must have absolute priority in all measures regarding food safety.
we in the alde group will support our own amendments, of course, but not other amendments that seek to weaken this report further.

mr president, i welcome these reports because protecting regional specialities is right and necessary.
this seems to me to be theology not politics and derives from faith and not reason.

given the time now, i expect that we will have a lot of votes to continue with after the speech by the president.
i underline the word investment.

if that is a community approach, then we in london want to see less of it.

much was said about the economic and social policies that were supposed to emanate from lisbon.
we support his proposal to reduce the additional bureaucratic processes required in adapting to the new system and thus ensuring compliance with gatt requirements.
the only real difference this year is that the commission has been more strident in denying its responsibility for the mess.

i hope this time we shall achieve some conclusive results.
again, i do not want to anticipate, as this house will be debating the russian elections on thursday.
i shall speak later on the subject of iraq but, while our attention is focused on that country, there are atrocious activities going on in other parts of the world.
- the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on egypt.
there is now a new reason for hastening slowly on enlargement.
there has never been any talk in the commission of any special treatment or fast track.
they are political because we are moving on.
mr president, i rise not on my usual point of order but on something arising from what mr herman said.
mr president, with regard to this particular resolution, let me say i am appalled at the opportunist hypocrisy of certain groups and certain individuals in this house.
although these principles are established in the current legislation, i welcome the changes and additional clarifications that have been introduced to strengthen these important aspects.
mr president, with regard to mrs auroi' s question on fraud in the member states.
may i remind you of the existing nice treaty, which requires you to take all decisions as close to citizens as possible?
i did wonder some months ago whether to table amendments, which would suggest a less ambitious outcome, but which would perhaps be more acceptable to member states.
the fact that we now embrace all hard woods in this particular directive is a sensible start.
we need to try to make it more relevant to context of modern financial markets.
such reports are an ominous sign and strengthen the case for an international stabilisation force to prevent any possibility of a slide to civil war.
this is about accountability to the citizen, because it concerns very important decisions.
as one informed commentator said after reviewing the evidence, if it was not the north koreans, it must have been the martians!

the european social market economy and the common currency are cornerstones of the world economy and the global financial system.
refugees have died in holding pens in modern-day europe, without sanitation or proper services.
the problem is that the same techniques could be utilised to degrade the quality of service to unacceptably low levels.
so the no-fly zones are vital in avoiding humanitarian disaster.
plans for the later years of the programme are less detailed at this stage.
it is in that spirit that i recently launched a reflection process on how europe's trade defence instruments such as the anti-dumping instrument operate in the modern global economy.
in the on-line world, we must think differently.

recent modest improvements in some european union economies have been achieved the european union.
an objective appraisal would admit that in creating the euro the eu has tried to create a silk purse from a pig’s ear.
this is only one example of the failings of this report.

how often will it meet?
this report is about lobbying.
if there is to be a change, however, it would require full agreement of the other member states, but it is something which we are examining.
we believe that such an endeavour is in the interests of the eu.
we remain confident that all remaining concerns will be addressed during that accession process.
they and their families depend on the priority we and the member states will give to such an important and serious problem.
we have done a lot on this issue.

its geopolitical and economic importance for the eu is constantly increasing in terms of security, stability and energy.
we are trying to find a wording that will address the issue: whether to call it pakistan-administered kashmir and indian-administered kashmir, as i have suggested.
emphasis will probably be put on temporary dwellings and repair works for essential public infrastructure like schools and hospitals.
all the activities pursued by the member states also benefit the european union.
secondly, conflict prevention must be a priority of the european union.
there is much to commend this resolution, and with careful thought, greater progress can be expected against the problems of the financial crisis.
but here i have real concerns, and i would like to question the commission on this particular point.
the downturn in economies will have its effects.
the european union has delivered on this commitment.
my second point: i welcome president obama's commitment to diplomacy with the islamic republic of iran.

madam president, commissioner, i would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the production of this report.
together with the start of the visa dialogue, it gave a clear signal to the people of that country that their future lies in the european union.

in particular, financial services is a very positive issue whereby administrations and politicians on both sides of the atlantic have seen real progress.

it can carry a large and varied cargo all at once.
the people of iraq are still paying the price of the last war in cancers, leukaemias and deaths.
that is the challenge before us, and i think we can make great use of this possibility of an exchange of best practices and information and close cooperation.
the intention is to lay down specific rules for other nutrients and other ingredients at a later stage as scientific knowledge improves.
this is the first to see the light of day.
it will be the general public.

it was extremely foolish and short-sighted of this house to vote the way it did on the reports last month.
mr president, georgia is not just another international crisis to which the eu has to respond.
we have also strengthened freedom to travel within the eu and established the european borders agency.
this is an integrated approach which i hope to address in a later question by another member of the house.
but have we actually destroyed the world market or, is it brazil, as mr kreissl-dörfler has just said?

we talk about the report, which is about sound financial management.
the initial suggestion from the commission was that we should limit this dosing to cement used for manual use.

our thoughts go out to all of those who were affected by that dramatic action.
the question of extending its mandate subsequently should be addressed on the basis of experience.
our twin reports in parliament on human rights in the world and human rights in the union demonstrate the importance we place on this issue.
we are not heading toward the kind of problems that you ask about here.

i am conscious that many of the commissioners would much rather be in france campaigning for a ‘yes’ vote.

that report, as promised at our previous meeting, will be transmitted to parliament by the end of this year.
i can tell you that the victims of lockerbie in scotland and the victims of ira atrocities in my country knew very well what sort of scoundrel this man was.
that means that these substances are safe if their consumption stays below the acceptable daily intake.

we would certainly wish to ensure that the united states acted in accordance with wto rules.
the commission has submitted a proposal to reinforce controls on the movement of animals.

the commission, as i understand it, has all the information it requires on this matter.
finally, let me quote jana mittermaier of transparency international: 'the new register will be a test of the commitment of all parties involved in lobbying to greater openness.'

i realise that you cannot force people either to grow or to eat organic food.
the committee did, however, agree to take a coherent approach to the law relating to the internet.

in writing. - i support this report on the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between parliament and the commission on a common transparency register.

the answer simply must be 'no'!
on behalf of the ind/dem group. - mr president, the rapporteur claims that this initiative will encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to expand their cross-border business.
in writing. - the commission's green paper on this issue was a damning indictment and an honest recognition that the common fisheries policy has not worked.
i feel that this is the spirit in which we must look at decisions on combating terrorism.
we are all committed to finding solutions.
so it cannot be a cover-up.
i have learned a lot here today.
finally, mr bashir is going to be given a red carpet welcome in lisbon: it is not only mr mugabe.
so there really is an imperative to prepare the union for enlargement by dealing firstly with the institutional situation that needs to be remedied.
it goes much further than we went in the uruguay round.
a key task of the partnership will be to help member states improve the development and implementation of their cancer plans.
i, therefore, welcome both these reports and, in particular, i support mr oostlander's conclusions that the commission's plan is heavy on rhetoric but light on concrete action.
this is our strongest card and the closer we get to implementing the new emissions trading system, the stronger it gets.
i would remind you that we have enhanced transparency as regards expert groups in the context of negotiations on the framework agreement.

we must recognise these.

it is regrettable that we are not sending our highest official to attend that conference on behalf of the community.
this is very dangerous, and we need to have much more rigorous assessment of how patients are cared for, on a regular basis.
the first is the decision by the committee on budgets to place into reserve the monies agreed for the life programme.
that is something on which i am confident we can all agree.
nevertheless, and in conclusion, i should like to say that we are always open to suggestions.
i think we have done quite enough.
firstly, there are executive agencies, which are clearly the responsibility of the commission, and for which you give discharge to the commission.
however, a direct deduction of any spending items from the deficit is excluded.
it makes the point that protection of these freedoms is integral to, and inseparable from, the protection of all human rights.

and what does it profit anyone to fish our waters out?
their understanding was crucial for me.
yet in the current economic crisis, there are signs that european solidarity is being undermined.
we have also continued to improve cooperation through the productive interaction between the european defence agency and the allied command for transformation.

what is this fishmeal used for?
president saakashvili overreacted, since violence is not an appropriate solution when addressing the justified concerns of the opposition.
you mentioned the commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that france is acting.
madam president, tuberculosis, or tb as it was known in my country, was rampant in ireland a little over half a century ago, killing many people, young and old.
that is why it issues regular press releases on them in order to provide citizens with information on the main issues involved.
it is time to turn this into a reality by closely coordinating our positions and strategy.
so the same argument applies now to the nomination of the commission.
i am of course referring in particular to the issue of the kosovo status talks.
to be quite honest, i cannot answer this question today.
the third point is that we really need to start thinking about the different elements of the constitution and look at it in two parts.
so i have one request to you mr barroso.
this means, i assume, that one of his last tasks before leaving office was to deal with the immediate aftermath of the terrible bombings in madrid.

this, as you know, is one of our major demands to the turkish authorities.
i have a direct question for the commissioner.
let us look at the clear facts before us.
however, we have to find where the problems are at present.
this report has paid particular attention to enabling a greater number of disadvantaged and underdeveloped regions to catch up with those which are more developed.
it is also extremely hypocritical in that it criticises the echelon interception system, while at the same time we are planning to establish a european secret service.
i just want to say one more thing about meda and the reform of our external aid which is relevant to debates which members are having elsewhere.
that does not, of course, justify us ignoring our own traditional positions.
it is really very important and my constituents were very grateful to learn just how much had been done in that respect.
we must all be worried that the commission was so concerned about the reports of the disease's existence that apparently it decided to deny it altogether.

in line with the proposed conclusion decisions, the commission will further submit to parliament, every three years, a report on the energy community.
i will carefully consider the main concerns expressed by the rapporteur and by parliament in relation to the green paper.
i support this as a policy objective because one of the criticisms of european legislation in general is that it is just not implemented in time.
i know members would wish to discuss the issue, even if not to decide on it.
during the recent eu-india summit, the issue of trade barriers to scotch whisky was raised.
that is how things are.
in normal circumstances we expect a response the next day.
we have managed to increase our ability to deliver humanitarian assistance.
it is not acceptable that business as usual will start again with the argument that there is no alternative.
i think we have to face some facts.
it leads to a lot of confusion.
all the volumes nominated are reaching their destinations, so this means that most of the consumers have full supply of gas.
the implementation of key provisions of the eu white paper on food safety is of paramount importance if we are to restore confidence in the food chain.
nothing could be further from the truth, and we are hearing it again in this chamber today.
of course, what works in the private context and what works for an individual consumer choice does not automatically or neatly convert into a prescribed public policy.
several members have made reference in their speeches to the equality of status enjoyed by both the larger and smaller member states of the european union.
this is the core of the problem when it comes to the issue of enlargement of the european union.
mr president, i, too, wish to welcome my dublin colleague, ruairi quinn, the irish minister for finance and the president-in-office of ecofin, to parliament this afternoon.

i take issue with mr sacrédeus at only one stage: unfortunately, the women and the children who are the victims in this particular case are exploited from birth.
various speakers mrs randzio-plath and also others have expressed some doubts as to whether the current monetary policy stance is optimal.
it is for that reason that i voted for the report.
if and when we want to promote the biotechnology industry and its possibilities, we must always be open about it, otherwise we will not be successful.
this means that the afghan crisis is considered from an angle that does not simply mirror the american perspective on it.
they are working on such a proposal and will present it as soon as possible.
the cap is not perfect, but it has been reformed.
we want to know where the directive is being tested in the courts.
it is certainly the case that an impressive number of parliament's amendments have already been adopted and i think congratulations are due to the rapporteur.
there are, however, other areas where member states can take effective action themselves and where they can cooperate and benefit from experiences gained in other member states.
it is a solid record of achievement.
negotiations are progressing but still there is a potential to increase efforts on both sides in these negotiations.
it distorts our gdp/gnp figures dramatically.
no, it is obvious for us insiders that it means equivalence with the council.
that is why we insist in this vote today that enlargement is impossible without further institutional change.
this parliament does not take seriously enough its monitoring duty.
in the event of fire it is just as important to record the details of passengers travelling by eurotunnel to ensure their safe evacuation in the event of a fire.
those organisations may be delivering, but the un process itself in new york is not.
more experience equals more skill, equals more pay.
i talk to my farmers every day, and some of these people are most probably going to lose their farms.
for that reason it is important that the igc does not take any step backwards.
every step of the industry's chain of production is regulated, 'from farm to fork' so to speak.
first, the very social model and the idea of social solidarity that we, and i, believe in is put at risk.
how could it be otherwise in a democracy?
we really must look at what we are doing in this area.
now, it is a pleasure to invite the president of the european commission, josé manuel barroso, to make his contribution.
another theme that features strongly in the report is regulatory arbitrage between different families of investment products.
mr president, i wish to speak briefly on another point of order in relation to the minutes.
some of these questions were tabled in december, but we waited patiently for three months to put the questions to her.
this also has a serious affect on immigration policies within the community.
i believe it is our responsibility to protect children from harmful material and some of those who conduct online lines.
the commission is not in a position to tell individual member states what to do.
once again, i should like to thank mr söderman.
it is quite simple.
the principle of one suit fits all is discriminatory when special circumstances occur.
or are we going to continue with a situation where the press are just going to use it to attack member states?
is it acceptable that the eu institutions go to the court of justice over the council's decision to moderate the increase in salaries of eu civil servants?
this is a great improvement and we should remember that.
that is why the report recommends a central eu database including information on all animal experiments approved, currently performed and finalised.
but it then goes on to posit the european union as an alternative or antidote to such totalitarianism.
similarly, we need a pan-european financial services authority to maintain order and transparency between financial institutions.
let me also briefly mention the support measures we are putting in place under the instrument for pre-accession assistance (ipa).
at the same time, we feel that the conclusions of the negotiations over the detail of the management regime put in place are much too weak.
- the debate is closed.
colleges of supervisors are essential.
this is why they should benefit from the eu financial instruments to a much greater degree than they have so far.
we will achieve equality simply because justice and goodness are on our side.
the context in which this question is asked is also clear.
freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are fundamental human rights for everybody, which the state has a duty to protect.
beneath all of this is the interinstitutional battle and both mr prodi and parliament are desperate to preserve the community method, fearing there is too much intergovernmentalism about.
nothing less than root-and-branch reform of the cap will do.
mr president, i welcome the fact that at long last we have resolved this issue of the european company statute.
it will be used mainly by experts and educational authorities, but it is for the benefit of the citizen.
this will be replaced with the simpler system under which companies can use their regular vat returns to deduct vat incurred in another member state.
cattle breeds are different because the gene pool to which they belong has been modified through selection for certain characteristics.
i will read his views as rapporteur to you.
i hope we can clarify our responses to some of those questions in the weeks and months ahead.

around the mediterranean the three monotheistic religions - judaism, christianity, islam - were founded and fostered and spread throughout the known world.
this is just the first of many reports and many investigations that my committee will continue to make, because this is a long-term project.
we are in the middle of a very complicated issue.
the range of foreign policy issues that the union now deals with and the breadth and intensity of the union’s contacts with its partners around the globe is truly extensive.
serious clarifications must be given by the us government to the issues that have been raised.
other similar regions have similar concerns, for example catalonia, the basque country and wales.
i would appreciate it if, on the close of this item of business, i might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my group.
madam president, i should just like to say before i start that it is a bit rich of mr donnelly to say that people should not have a trade war.
we look to the spring council in march to reverse the failures of recent times and put europe firmly on a free market and enterprise-driven path.
that was quite obvious, and that was also partly why the market could not work.
it seems to me blatantly absurd that greece should continue to pursue this long-standing and, frankly, ridiculous tirade against the name of macedonia.
for example, the joint research centre institute in seville that deals with prospective future technologies is looking at this area.
give us some hope that it will happen.
markets in europe, in the different countries, are different, and therefore we should not try to impose a blanket coverage of regulation which would apply to all of them.
however, i want to reiterate the fact that the situation is serious but we should not panic.
this is why these multilateral negotiations continue to be the eu’s top trade priority.
only by following in the footsteps of our forefathers can we be faithful to the eu's inheritance and make the inevitable inconceivable - and that is what peacemaking means.
for those who have been there lately, it is green gunk nowadays.
the practice of hostage-taking constitutes a serious threat to the population.
consumers demand food that is of good quality, safe and traceable.
indeed, it is already clear that the fuel used in this sector in some member states will have to be improved in the future.
the competitive benefits will probably induce at least some of their medium-sized competitors to adopt basel ii too.
i hope all candidate countries will participate in the convention, under the principles of helsinki, namely equal treatment.
any use of pnr must be in line with eu data protection standards.
mr barroso has already mentioned some short-term measures.
i have to say that it is not so simple.
this is a good report and the rapporteurs have worked really hard on it.
the proposed approach to the definition of professional investor, as set out in both reports, would seem to offer additional advantages from the perspective of a properly functioning single passport.
my suggestion is that this process should be as inclusive and as open as possible.
however, if we are to succeed in this, our member states must join forces and participate in this exercise.
when you are talking about jobs and the money in people's pockets, you are talking about issues that very clearly affect the lives of every citizen of the european union.
i accept the decision.
it is yet another own goal.
i am very optimistic that they will be accepted also by the council.
nevertheless, if we demand that action is taken and money is spent, we should also be prepared to help in any way we can, including offering technical and financial support.
there are also issues on which our views fundamentally differ, such as how to tackle climate change, and on some aspects of human rights and international law.
the lisbon agenda gave us a decade to reform.
amnesty international has recently identified china as one of the world’s major arms exporters, with increasing influence in asia, africa and latin america.
i have no crystal ball to see where the multilateral talks in the dda will go from where we left them in july.
i was in washington in july on a mission as chair of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection.
the european commission also offers fast-track procedures to state aid, which is appreciated.
i therefore welcome the recent proposal to introduce stress tests for nuclear installations, as well as the entry into force of the directive on nuclear safety.
it simply penalises the ordinary, hard-working greek people for the profligacy of their politicians and the desire of those same politicians to prop up the doomed currency union.
allow me to explain some of our main considerations in this regard.
the european council is united in its wish for the treaty to enter into force by the end of this year and the end of the swedish presidency.
madam president, a decade ago there was much speculation about climate change, but today it is very much a reality as we see the future unfolding before our eyes.
the only thing which raises questions about it are bleepers like that, even when they play 'ode to joy'.
with the new timing of the equivalence decisions, we will be able to work in parallel towards common agreed objectives.
this will particularly be the case during the current economic situation.
again, we are getting a better use of the reserve.
i will not ask any particular questions after that.
all technologies must be considered.
i have been fortunate to have worked closely with a disadvantaged youth group from wales, my own nation, who received funding under the programme.
two points struck me immediately in the speeches and comments i heard earlier on.
despite some progress, there are still gaps in this process.
it seems strange that in a shared management system only half of the partnership needs to be responsible.
but maybe we have an answer to that.
the deployment of easo teams to the member states affected by these flows will also be considered, with a view to helping the authorities screen the asylum seekers.
there are some signs that russia is increasing the pressure in regard to energy policy.
it is a very small amount of money.
it is regrettable, therefore, that eu member states are resisting a rapid ratification of this particular convention.
because of a lack of legal base and little progress on energy we are sending our delegates to kyoto with very little in their bags.
member of the commission. - madam president, i wish to thank you for a very concise but important debate and congratulate mrs neyts-uyttebroeck on her report and initiative.
we know, for instance, that within the framework of the review the spanish government has put forward suggestions concerning asylum and immigration.
the cross-referencing of witness statements and eurocontrol records has established that some eu states have serious questions to answer and have so far refused to come clean.
on behalf of the ppe-de group. - madam president, i find what the commissioner has said rather disappointing.
this has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources.
therefore, on behalf of the thule survivors, and in the hope of future work to review the treaty, i commend the report to you, unamended.
what benefit accrues to ireland for the risk of being exposed to the majority of britain's nuclear installations?
what we need to do is to guarantee financial support for this particular sector.
mr president, i am very grateful to be asked my opinion, but i rather doubt that it will be my decision.
common basic principles for immigrant integration policy within the european union have been established.
benefits which we can work towards are specifically and generally a positive.
citizens are watching us.
the social instability in the new member states is endangering political stability and economic growth not only in those states, but also in the eu as a whole.
as you rightly stated, probably the best way of stimulating sme participation is to cut down on red tape.
i would like to be convinced that the opposite is true.
it is important that more money is available, but it is also important that we should seek here to enhance the socially-inclusive europe citizens clearly desire.
many governments have failed ordinary citizens.
the proposals funded are those which receive the highest overall mark for the call or part of the call they address.
our fishing communities are crying out for help.
this should be condemned by parliament as contrary to the rule of law.
a key part of this proposal, of course, is the authorisation stage.
as stipulated in the negotiating framework, turkey should consolidate and broaden legislation and implement measures on, , freedom of expression, freedom of religion and minority rights.
condemning the use of force and violence is a duty for all parties involved.
that is to say, one partner abducts, the other abducts and then the other abducts again.
on the subject of migration i wish to reply here to several questions that have been raised by members of this parliament.
the ideas programme will introduce a new mindset in supporting and conducting research in europe.
why is the commission so slow in acting?
now the institutions and the member states, including the labour government in the uk, are dishonestly pretending that these cosmetic changes justify breaking their promise of a referendum.
this is also a discussion on the adjustment of the emissions trading system.
however, there is also an equally important seventh question: it is the old issue about national declarations.
perhaps very little, but at least highlighting it here today is important.
first of all, regarding the economics, it is quite clear that the outcome of the financial perspectives has not been very encouraging to many of us.
this is also an integral part of any democracy.
finally, we, as british conservatives, are looking for a change in direction, towards the development of an independent competition authority.
i would also like to appeal to him to look in particular at the issues around van production, which is the production within luton.
centralization in london does not work.
the changes to the market are hopefully leading in that direction.
there is no doubt of course that, in many cases, duty-free affects the cost of airport fares and ferry charges.
mr president, i would like to start by giving my warmest congratulations to our two rapporteurs who have prepared our debates today on behalf of our committee.
china gets away with a huge amount of wrong-doing and it is about time we stood up to them as well.
mr president, my group welcomes the batteries directive as an important first attempt to take these potentially environmentally damaging substances out of the waste stream.
we must hope that it stays that way, but we cannot be complacent.
we produce thousands of these brochures every year, but where do they end up?
i welcome parliament's support on the need to ensure that number portability is completed within one day.
mr president, i welcome the commissioner and i thank the rapporteur for her work.
the next item is the statement by the president-in-office of the council on the programme of the irish presidency.
president of the commission. - of course, the college was permanently informed by the commissioner responsible about the negotiation process.
clearly the european union, as the largest exporter of services, has a strong interest in opening new markets for services.
we must look towards common solutions to europe's problems, whilst respecting the choice of each eu member state by allowing them to decide how we progress.
we have therefore tabled an alternative resolution which contains all the elements of her report which we do support.
liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services.
we owe it to the sudanese people in both north and south to stand by them and offer them support and encouragement at this critical time.
the commission thinks that labelling will eventually make these products more competitive, to the benefit of the industry, and in particular to those who produce in a welfare-friendly manner.
he knows perfectly well that ours is a non-political head of state.
i think it is very important to say this.

another example is the directive on biofuels.

it is an honour to be invited here to speak on behalf of the uk presidency.
i shall be totally honest with the house this morning.

perhaps simultaneous interpretation problems are to blame here.
the commission has strong institutional powers, which it could use to actively drive the ipp process.
our aim remains common, but our approach may be somewhat different.
measures are also aimed at protecting the interests of the maghreb states, as well as those poor developing countries which export textile and clothing products.

mr president, very much in the same tone as mr gil-robles i voted against referral back and for the amendment which, sadly, was rejected.
the case of troy davis is, i think, an absolutely classic example of the real problems with the implementation of the death penalty.

member of the commission. - mr president, population and housing censuses are the central building block for all statistical reporting on the people that live in the european union.
i want to ask three things.
what we have here is the basis for opening up the european union market in a genuine sense.
if there is, that shows why we need to put it in.
you are an untouchable, faceless, bureaucratic body in brussels.
the lord mayor of leicester, councillor john allen and the lady mayoress, mrs allan, are in the public gallery.
we also raised concerns regarding the human rights situation in russia, notably the killing of mrs politkovskaya.
coming as i do from a small island state similar to malta, i can testify to the eu's commitment to the development of small and underdeveloped peripheral regions.
i am sure the commission would agree with that.
but to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on.
the survivors still wait for justice: compensation and medical assistance in many cases.

the european union is an ideological project being forced upon european peoples who would rather live in democratic nation states.
this flexibility works in favour of the labour market but not for women who want and need social security, employment guarantees and reconciliation of private and professional life.
after independence, the russian government used the same weapon to punish the baltic states for not joining the cis and for demanding the removal of russian troops.
the code, however, is only a political commitment between member states.
your footprint will remain with us for five years.
i am not going to outsource that responsibility.
all countries must now transpose the directive.
i also believe that it is essential for the development of the cfsp that the eu plays a major role.
in addition, this situation is not coherent with the positive trend of relations between libya and the european union.
there is a yawning gap, an unbridgeable gap.
fining the french organising committee means taking money away from grassroots football and from the promotion of the game and putting that money into the coffers of the european commission.
so our balkan strategy is what it should be: strategic in its objectives, multi-faceted in terms of instruments and tailor-made in terms of implementation.
this legislative act will therefore be signed tomorrow.
this is not a satisfactory situation.
it was unanimously agreed that climate change requires 'prompt action' and 'swift and determined policy responses'.
well, everyone is against that.
there will most probably be standardisation, and a ban on certain uses for magnets.
i took it for granted that they would feature in the debate on the financial transactions tax.

this is part of the european union's emergent common immigration policy, in which it will dictate who can and cannot migrate to member states and on what terms.

we must not allow the hardliners to gain the upper hand.
mr president, it is very late at night for such a serious debate and the commissioner must be tired.

the commission fully shares this position.
general morillon asked the specific question of what we know about the attitude of the people of iraq to their own regime, what we know about their ambitions and aspirations.
undoubtedly, this regulation will work in tandem with the hague convention on the transnational abduction of children.
second, there is too much red tape and too many complicated financing procedures.
the application of a default mrl, however, raises a problem – what to do with all the national mrls that we already have and that are not yet harmonised.

i agree very much with gunnar hökmark who said earlier that we should not let member states get away from their responsibility.

also, charging for unbundled access to the local loop should be fair and adequate to ensure the long-term development and upgrading of the local access infrastructure.

it builds on existing community instruments, putting them to concerted use in a new framework.
but that is not all: we need our representatives to be present at all the eu delegation meetings, including those where tactics and policy are discussed.
we are proud of our record and we do not want to dent it as a result of this.
to tackle that misinformation fully we must put our own house in order and reform the european union tobacco production sector rapidly and completely.
my own government is taking a reckless approach to it.

the resolution is also right to point out that, in trying to restore public order, it is vitally important that human rights are not violated.
we must end this travelling circus, and parliament itself must be at the heart of the debate.
you also called for a more explicit message.
mr president, this is an important debate on two very important reports, but it is an issue which the house has been covering both earlier today and indeed yesterday.
